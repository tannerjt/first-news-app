My first news app
=================

This application was built following the tutorial built by the University of Missouri IRE [here](http://first-news-app.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#).  The tutorial highlights a traditional workflow of creating mapping applications for journalism using Python [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).  The original GitHub repo can be found [here](https://github.com/ireapps/first-news-app/blob/master/docs/index.rst).

The final product is hosted on github pages [here](http://tannerjt.github.io/first-news-app/build/).  The application uses a comma separated values file as the backend data provider.
